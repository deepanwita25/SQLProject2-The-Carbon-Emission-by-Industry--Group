# SQLProject2-The-Carbon-Emission-by-Industry-Group

This is a SQL Project on DataCamp that I worked on recently to increase my querying proficiency.
Let's talk about the data then!!! The dataset _**'prouduct_emissions'**_ contains data about carbon footprints of various companies associated with an industry group. Carbon footprint is denoted by the column carbon_footprint_pcf (PCF: Product Carbon Footprint).
In this project, I was tasked to find out for the recent year in the table, what is the PCF emission of different industry groups, number of companies and the total carbon footprint emission.
I have used an SQL code that can be found in the jupyter notebook attached with this project.
Please note, the dataset was provided by datacamp and it is available in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9#Sec9 for reference.
